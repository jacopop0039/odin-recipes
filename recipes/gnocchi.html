    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Red potatoes (1kg)</li>
            <li>Type 00 flour (300g)</li>
            <li>Eggs (1 - medium size)</li>
            <li>Fine salt</li>
            <li>Remilled durum wheat semolina</li>
        </ul>
                
    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare potato gnocchi, start by boiling the potatoes. Arrange the potatoes in a large pot and cover with plenty of cold water. From the moment the water starts boiling, count about 30-40 minutes, depending on their size. Try the fork test and if the tines enter without difficulty then you can drain the potatoes. While still hot, mash the potatoes on the flour that you have sifted on the pastry board in a fountain shape</li>
            <li>There will be no need to peel the potatoes because the peel will remain inside the potato masher. Then add the lightly beaten egg together with a pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Mix everything with your hands until you get a soft but compact dough. Remember that if you knead it too much, the gnocchi will become hard during cooking, so just knead the time necessary. Take a part of the dough and roll it out with your fingertips to get 0.8 inches (2 cm) thick loaves</li>
            <li>To do this, help yourself by sprinkling some semolina flour on the work surface from time to time. Meanwhile, cover the remaining dough with a towel to prevent it from drying out.</li>
            <li>Cut the loaves into chunks and, by pressing lightly with your thumb, drag them onto the rigagnocchi board to obtain the classic shape. If you don't have the one, you can use a fork and drag them on the tines. Use semolina flour to prevent them from sticking together. As you prepare the <strong>potato gnocchi</strong>, arrange them on a tray with a lightly floured cloth, well spaced from each other</li>
            <li>If you intend to cook them, you can pour them a few at a time into boiling salted water; as soon as they come to the surface, the gnocchi are cooked and ready to be drained and seasoned.</li>
        </ol>
